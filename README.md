# docker-kivy-rpi-headless

> Docker base-image for headless [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) applications on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)

To run Kivy applications without an X server on the Raspberry Pi, the SDL libraries need to be re-compiled.

This image contains the necessary dependencies and matching SDL libraries to run a Kivy app without a graphics environment (headless).


## How to Use

### Dockerfile

This image is indended to be used as a base-image for Kivy applications:

```
FROM: mrtux/kivy-rpi-headless:2.1-bullseye
```

### Requirements

The requirements [Cython](https://cython.org/) and [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) are already satisfied by this container.
Especially Kivy has been compiled with regard the SDL libraries, so it should not be overwritten.

The following requirements are safe and will match the installation in the container:
```
Cython==0.29.32
Kivy==2.1.0
```

To be a bit more flexible, the patch version can be omitted:
```
Cython~=0.29
Kivy~=2.1
```
